Contains 5 customisable and toggleable gameplay modifies to make your gameplay expereince as awful as possible:

1) Mouse jittering : Apply random offsets to your mouse position at intervals.
2) Screen rotation : Rotates your view (But not gameplay!) based on things in the world or at a set rate.
3) Cursor hitbox : Your cursor has a hitbox now, anything that would hit the cursor, hits you!
4) Time bomb : A timer ticks down constantly that kills you once it reaches zero. Pickups spawn near you to reset the timer.
5) Vision problems : A certain radius of your screen dictates whether you can see within or beyond it.
